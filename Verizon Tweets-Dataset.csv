13,Poor service,4,"Screw @Verizon. 200+ a month for phones that never get service. Oh, and their customer service is terrible too. They respond, try to “fix” the issue, but nothing ever gets done. Buying out of our contract ASAP."
14,Poor service,4,@verizon Verizon sucks lies and should be out of business for the way it treats it customers
15,Poor service,4,@verizon I’m in Fort Lauderdale and have no signal. Extremely disappointed.

17,Churning/Lost customer,1,"@verizon So, are you guys going to give me a fair deal after 20 years of being a loyal customer or am I switching to @TMobile  tomorrow?"
18,Potential New Customer,5,"@verizon if I still have money to pay off on my AT&amp;T iPhone, can I still switch to Verizon?"

24,Poor service,4,@VerizonSupport @verizon but when I call Verizon you guys put me on hold when I need my phone lines open for my business!
25,Potential New Customer,5,Going to Verizon is my first move in the morning
26,Poor service,4,@VerizonSupport @verizon what’s the point of the chat when you guys can’t fix anything. 1)Earl tells me to contact a billing specialist!
27,Poor service,4,@VerizonSupport @verizon why are you still charging me!

34,Poor service,4,Verizon is trash
35,Poor service,4,Ever wonder why there are so many @VZWNow @verizon @VZWSupport ? It’s because they all fuckin’ suck!!! Shady bitches! ????your company.
36,Poor service,4,"@verizon My phone bill is really high. Even with a military discount. It's my fault though. I live in a metropolitan area, so Verizon is pretty much unnecessary. Like, every provider has good service here. Anyway, I'm leaving when my contract is up."

38,Poor service,4,Verizon sucking some big ass dick
39,Happy Customer,2,Finally got that unlimited data on verizon ?
40,Happy Customer,2,"Switched from T-Mobile to Verizon and now WiFi calling works at my house. Also, I’ll actually have cell service at my house, and everywhere else. Huge relief"
41,Potential New Customer,5,You need to get rid of the stupid only @ATT phones count policy. We're done with ATT.No reason to stay. We get stuck with tier 1 kids paid to pimp ATT phones.I have a call scheduled at 08:30 MST to move our phones to Verizon.@ATTCares
42,Poor service,4,Hello how

45,Poor service,4,Motherfuck!! @verizon
46,Poor service,4,I pay way too much for @Verizon for my service to be as crappy as it’s become. I need to go ahead and make the switch because this is ridiculous.
47,Poor service,4,@verizon they suspended my twitter account because I told the truth about your shitty business practices. But I'll just use instagram and the phone to let people know you are a piece of shit company with lousy customer service. Consider it a PSA...FUCK YO
48,Poor service,4,@verizon @VerizonSupport @VZWSupport Your company is pathetic and your customer service is worthless. FUCK YOU!! Placing your customers on hold for 45 mins is not service it's annoying you ass clowns!
49,Poor service,4,@verizon you fuckin' scumbags!
50,Poor service,4,@verizon fuckin' sucks! Come to @verizon if you want to experience SHITTY customer service.
51,Poor service,4,@RamblinRay890 @VerizonSupport @ATT I've been contemplating leaving Verizon also. Nothing but issues with my service lately. Not to mention the money I'm spending..
52,Poor service,4,@VZWSupport Question. My Verizon acct is linked to phone. Pay 1 bill. Go to store to change something. Told store can't do bc of link. Must cancel to do. True? Want linking discount.
53,Poor service,4,"Terrible, terrible customer service. Terrible. https://t.co/GhXqmx9vg5"
54,Poor service,4,"I should’ve never switched to Verizon, this phone bill is high asf."
55,Poor service,4,"Well @verizon, after troubleshooting one of my two cable boxes and telling me to return it, you deactivate the wrong one remotely before I can give you the correct serial number. 1-5 hours on tech support tonight. One broken box. One deactivated."
56,Happy Customer,2,@verizon I'm fine that after 15gbs on the jetpack it goes to 600kbps but if I see 245.64kbps again I'm going to flip out. Do to that 245.64kbps I lagged out of 2 competitive matches. #thanksverizon

60,Happy Customer,2,"@VZWSupport @VerizonSupport was really helpful in switching over my phones. A much more pleasant experience than calling, and you’re not on hold for ages. Thank you again Verizon. Much appreciated."
61,Happy Customer,2,@FatKidDeals looking for an iPhone 7. Either Verizon or unlocked.
62,Poor service,4,I fucking hate the Verizon guys face

65,Poor service,4,"CUSTOMER SERVICE DISASTER @verizon!  Bought four new iPhones for family - Verizon rep backed up all phones to icloud, erased the old phones and sent us on our way.  BUT screwed up one of the backups - all data lost!!"
66,Poor service,4,Verizon FiOS is a complete scam. Complete...#customerservicecc @VerizonSupport Worse than Comcast#scams#anythingbutFios
67,Poor service,4,"@verizon Nah, I’d rather you just lower your ridiculous fees for Fios"
68,Poor service,4,@bobbysprinkler @VerizonSupport I was there.  Leaving Verizon also.  Most disappointed in customer service I’ve ever been!
69,Happy Customer,2,@924LittleDevil Same. I have Verizon and I'm happy with the service.
70,Poor service,4,Verizon is supposed to be the worlds most trusted network but um I’m not trusting it right now.
71,Potential New Customer,5,@comcastcares I don’t have 6 hours to waste with someone on the phone. Would be quicker to have Verizon come install internet that works.
72,Poor service,4,"If @verizon is the ""Best network"", the other guys must suck beyond sucking... #VerizonSUCKS"
73,Potential New Customer,5,@ATT yo why is the service so bad??? I’ve been only having 2 bars lately I’m about to switch over to @verizon
74,Poor service,4,VERIZON REALLY TRASH NOW
75,Happy Customer,2,"Ah yes, the Internet and router we just upgraded for $20 more a month. Thank you @verizon https://t.co/tYfrufBtW0"
76,Happy Customer,2,@OldSlowSwimmer Verizon was long time att user before. Happy with both.  iPhone experience is identical on both really. My decision to go X was in large part b/c of camera &amp; screen size over the 8. I’m sure I would have been happy with 8 too.
77,Potential New Customer,5,My offer still stands I currently in limbo with access to both @comcastcares and @VerizonSupport who ever can finalize the better deal tomorrow will get my business. Comcast only offered me $5 less so far and Verizon told me there's nothing they can do.
78,Poor service,4,Verizon service is trash ?
79,Poor service,4,"@thewadekeller IDK, but Verizon sucks on the floor at the dome"

84,Poor service,4,"Verizon screwed me again! They didn’t show up for appointments which I videotaped ,missed several more appointments and then charged me for for missed appointment! Can’t get anyone on the phone to help. Now I have to take them to court"
85,Poor service,4,"Verizon wants you to report a problem on line, but their internet IS NOT WORKING"
86,Happy Customer,2,@kiademi_ What company. im at verizon never have slow downs even on hotspot
87,Happy Customer,2,"@VZWSupport Easy does it, JR. I love Verizon and am having no issues. Just looking for a way to boost signal when I’m in very desolate areas."
88,Happy Customer,2,Today I switched to @Verizon and bought an iPhone X because the guy at @ATT was rude and had no social skills...but the guy at Verizon offered me a job...I said no BUT I thought about it once they said they pay your tuition ?????
89,Poor service,4,@verizon why do I pay for internet that’s cuts off every couple days. Tired of resetting router just to connect to internet
90,Poor service,4,"If I have to see one more Middleditch Verizon commercial, I will let out a primal scream."
91,Happy Customer,2,@VZWSupport Thank you that’s why I’m with Verizon now
92,Poor service,4,Something is always wrong with Verizon
93,Poor service,4,I wonder if Verizon actually plans on crediting me for my service being out for 2 damn days ?
94,Poor service,4,"I went to Verizon to disconnect a phone number. They handed me a business card &amp; told me to call the number.  NO customer service. I stood there and called. 35 MIN LATER, a two min. transaction. Fuck that. They charge a fortune. Bye bye, V."
95,Poor service,4,"@Verizon has some of the worst Unlimited data I have ever used. For one it’s not even unlimited, once you hit a point they just slow it down. When they slow it down it feels like your trying to use WiFi at McDonalds. I mean it’s complete udder trash!"
96,Poor service,4,"The internet cut out right after I started streaming. So I have to use data to post this on Twitter. Thanks, Verizon."
97,Poor service,4,"@verizon look. I just switched over from sprint to you guys, and y’all are really fuckin me over. I’ve called your support team many times to get everything fixed and you guys can’t seem to do anything to help me. Should I just be switching back to "
98,Potential New Customer,5,@ATT I'll be switching to @verizon tomorrow after the crappy experience I've had today trying to file an insurance claim.
99,Happy Customer,2,Verizon never did this and I was with them 15-20 years. I received this via text message 3/29. #wow #customerappreciationwinHappy Anniversary from MetroPCS! It has been two years since you joined the MetroPCS family - just a little note to say thank you! :) #IAmMetro
100,Happy Customer,2,"Before with verizon i couldnt use most of my apps because it was so slow. Now my apps run at good speed, but facebook keeps crashing, with headphones in my google still comes up, and my phone decides when it wants to recieve texts and calls. SICK DOPE TITE."
101,Poor service,4,@verizon zero cell service on Miami Beach today--all day. How badly do you guys suck? Badly. #verizonsux
102,Poor service,4,"Honestly, verizon has been giving such a shitty service lately. #Done."

104,Poor service,4,Here I am in another issue with @verizon . Bunch of money grubbers! Apparently loyal customers mean nothing to them! Time to switch!
105,Potential New Customer,5,I might switch to Verizon.
106,Poor service,4,@optimum You guys have the worst fucking WiFi I have ever dealt with. Verizon is expensive as hell but I’ll gladly hand them every dollar I make for the rest of my life rather than deal with your constant cutouts and shit connection. I hope your patheti
107,Poor service,4,The bait and switch I’m getting via DM from Verizon is crazy. I can’t believe how unethical they are from a sales standpoint. Basically lied to me and now tell me it’s just the way it is. Someone update me on #themasters so I can know what’s going on!
108,Churning/Lost customer,1,"@TMobile Thankfully, I went back to T-Mobile recently and I'm so glad I did. I left Verizon and won't go back. Just not worth it."
109,Happy Customer,2,@Comcast why does your modem and router suck so much? My internet drops from my smart tv every thirty minutes since I regretfully switched from the superior Verizon Fios. If you tell me to restart my modem I will smash it with a hammer
110,Happy Customer,2,"So the third Verizon Guy was able to make the fix and we now have cable. Two weeks without TV and I’ve just about got used to not having the cacophony of endless cable news in my ears. Back to being permanently disgusted, outraged and stressed out..."

112,Poor service,4,"honestly Verizon is shitty, like why am I not getting reception in Walmart or fucking Avon of all places???"
113,Potential New Customer,5,@TMobileHelp You guys are still struggling to help me BUT I've had enough. Clear my account and replace my phone so that I can move to @verizon or another carrier of my choice who can provide BETTER customer service. No outgoing service since February...S
114,Poor service,4,Verizon Fios gonna expect me to pay them this week but can’t get my channels back on to work properly. Smh
115,Happy Customer,2,my moms buying our verizon guy that helped me with my phone today a soft pretzel from target and it’s making my day
116,Poor service,4,@Jumexpapi @verizon Can’t be in a phone call and use data at the same time. Only AT&amp;T let’s you do that
117,Potential New Customer,5,I might switch to Verizon or sum other company this weekend and get a new phone
118,Poor service,4,Like realshit she lives 5 min from the Verizon store and it’s going on 40 minutes me being here
119,Poor service,4,Anyone else on @verizon have their LTE drop as soon as they pick up a phone call and return as soon as you hang up?
120,Potential New Customer,5,@NicoleVillaluz Agreed AT&amp;T is cheaper but just came back to Verizon. And as I've always felt Verizon is expensive but you get the best service both customer svc and actual cell svc imo.
121,Poor service,4,@newmoney401 Yeah man that was bad lol Verizon can go thru some shit

127,Poor service,4,Ugh my mom has been on the phone w Verizon and they are so fucking stupid. Why can't these reps have information from previous phone calls so they don't act like we're lying. Bitch made a mistake and now someone giving my mom a hard time... Fuck these companies man. No respect.
128,Potential New Customer,5,@TMobile @sprint @verizon @comcast. I currently pay @ATT 110$ a month for two iphones and 8gb of data (both phones paid off). Who wants a lifelong customer?
129,Potential New Customer,5,@allied1987 @JohnLegere @TMobile @verizon When Verizon gives me free coffee and free Auntie Anne's and the stuff I get on T-Mobile Tuesdays then maybe I'll consider a different carrier. Until then I'm enjoying my Netflix and my free stuff on Tuesdays

131,Poor service,4,"@VZWSupport I would like to know why our phone order wasn't processed as promised and why none of your CSR could deal with the problem, including supervision.  Over 20 years I've been a Verizon wireless customer. We were at the store from 2:30 until 8:10P"
132,Poor service,4,Verizon has just sent an email from a pldonotreply address advising that problem has been resolved and ticket is closed. Phone does not work 2 mo.and counting. VERIZON has the worst customer service imaginable.

139,Happy Customer,2,@verizon Terrible experience yesterday upgrading our phones. I want to thank Marilyn and Zully at Verizon wireless Quakertown store for their hard work and perseverance in spite of the incompetence of their coworkers in customer service.
140,Happy Customer,2,@allied1987 @JohnLegere @TMobile @verizon Uhh defenetly not. Verizon is the best and I have proof. I have a very large family and I have about 50-60 cousins. About 30 of those families have T-mobile and ever single hour they say they have to rest the WiFi
141,Poor service,4,@JohnLegere @ATandT @verizon @sprint @TMobileHelp @Twitter @ATandT @sprint @verizon you suck because you ruined my credit because just like the rest of Americans we figured out that you're out to get us and I believe everyone should cancel the contract an
